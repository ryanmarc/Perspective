NewPerspective
==============

The original author of this add-on has seemingly abandoned the project, the original outdated add-on can be found [here](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/222046-perspective).

# Note:
This add-on will now be maintained and updated here, we plan on adding features and tweaks over time, based on what the community is asking for. But the ultimate goal is to simply keep this great add-on working for players to enjoy.

# About:

Perspective is an addon that tracks and displays units on the user's screen.

Perspective was inspired by the [Ayth_Quest](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/220588-ayth_quest) and [EntSpy](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/221350-entspy) addons. I loved what the addons did but always felt they lacked the degree of customization that I demand.  I tried to keep the performance as fast as possible, but there are sliders under the settings to adjust for better performance as needed.

If you find that a unit is not working quite right, target the unit and use the /pti command.  Paste that information along with your comments for better results.
